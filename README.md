# A simple Rock Paper Scissors game.

### Languages used

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript

---

### Rules

### Things I learned

- Creating functions of various purposes (playing rounds, keeping score, updating score, reseting a game)
- DOM Manipulation, specifically selecting buttons, updating text on scores/rounds and styling/colorizing button borders on who won each round.
- Revisiting HTML structure/CSS styling to make a simple UI, and make it responsive.
- Reviewed how to import assets such as fonts/icons to desired effect.

### Thoughts on project

- I had a lot of fun working through this project, using the HTML/CSS and JavaScript knowledge I've been studying to bring it all together and see my game come to life at the end. I'm happy with the result and while there are additional features I can always think of, perhaps I'll return to the project after I dive deeper into styling with CSS.
